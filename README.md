# java-library-app
A Java application for efficient library management is created using a client-server architecture and threads. The database for this application is built using MySQL DBMS, specifically utilizing the SQLYog graphical tool. The application is designed for library administrators to efficiently manage books, library members, and their borrowings.

Common App Library - contains domain classes and all shared files required for communication between the client and server.

Server App Library - server-side application that processes client requests and returns responses from the database. The server form allows custom configuration settings for each computer (username, password, and port). After the server form is launched, clients can connect to the server.
